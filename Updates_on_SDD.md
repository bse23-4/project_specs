# Updates and Suggestions ```summary of what was discussed with Dr Swaib```

# Update 1
	```We should be specific on the purpose of the system like:```
   - On Tenant side its purpose is to ease tenant payment.
   - On the lanlord side its purpose is to ease collection of rent and hnalding rent defaulters.
 
 ## Update 2 
 ```Specify how tenants are to be connected```
 - We should specify how tenants are connected on the meter eg ```either grouped``` or ```non grouped```.
 - For grouped, take an example of tenants grouped on one yaka meter.
 - For non-grouped, tenants share the same meter with the landlord.
 
 ## Update 3
 ```Notification```
 - We to include that we are to automate demand notices to tenants.
 
 ## Update 3
 - For person to pay for this case a tenant should be registerd with the system.```(This needs to be specified)```
 
 ## Update 4
 ```System functions```
 - Why are goals part of the system functions. ```needs to be checked as well```
 
 ## Update 5
 - Demand notices can be sent via ```email``` or ```phone sms```
 - We need to be specific on th grace period like we can set it for purposes of presentations.
 - The power cut-off should be specfic ```For rent and electric bills```
 
 ## Suggestion 1
 - Doctor suggested that we can automate payment of rent and electricity bills as along as the tenant has money on the system and the period is due.
 - The also notfy them is their account runs low
 
 ## Update 6
 ```Complaint module```
 - We should specify is its rejected with a reason
 
 ## Update 7
 ```Benefits```
 - What do tenants benefit from system:
 
 ### On Tenant side
 ```Tenants will not need to see the landlord in order to make the payment.```
 
 ### On Landlord side
 ```Lanlords will be sure of their rent after a month or agreed upon time.```
 
 ## Update 8
 ```Justification```
 - Since yaka meters are expensive to purchase we go for shared meter and in doing so we are 
   aiming at low costs and less money spent on paying for service fee for individual yaka meters.
 ## Corection 1
 - The statement that was stated that ```The NyumbaYo app was developed with landlord and tenants in mind``` needs to be changed.

## Suggesttion 2 
- Dr suggested that for te case of penalty we can say ```Power-cutoff``` or ```Surcharge```
- And in doing so we need to include we added a policy for tenants to decide whether to be cutoff or incur charges.
```but not just power cut off```

## Suggestion 3
- Dr also said if we can add a ```Recomendation``` section for this that we might have implement 
  but didn't and if someone wants to take on the project can easily jump in.
